Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Merge Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

**Sample Input**

```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

**Sample Output**

```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```
