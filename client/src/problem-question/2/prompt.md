Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

**Sample Input**

```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

**Sample Output**

```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```
