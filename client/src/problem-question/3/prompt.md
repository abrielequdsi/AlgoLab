Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Buble Sort algorithm to sort the array.

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order.

Just like the movement of air bubbles in the water that rise up to the surface, each element of the array move to the end in each iteration. Therefore, it is called a bubble sort.

**Sample Input**

```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

**Sample Output**

```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```
