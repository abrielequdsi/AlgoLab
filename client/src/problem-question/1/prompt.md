Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted version of that array. Use the Selection Sort algorithm to sort the array.

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array:

1. The subarray which is already sorted.
2. Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

**Sample Input**

```
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3]
```

**Sample Output**

```
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9]
```
